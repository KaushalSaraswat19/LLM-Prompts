To verify the accuracy of the statement "The Great Wall of China is the only man-made structure visible from space with the naked eye," we need to consult reliable sources.

1. **Consulting NASA:**
   According to NASA, the belief that the Great Wall of China is visible from space with the naked eye is a common misconception. NASA astronauts have clarified that the Great Wall is not easily visible from low Earth orbit without aid, and many other human-made structures, such as cities and highways, are also not visible without assistance.

2. **Expert Opinions:**
   Various experts and astronauts have debunked this myth. Astronaut Chris Hadfield, for instance, has stated that although the Great Wall is an impressive structure, it is difficult to see from space with the naked eye due to its narrow and irregular shape, which blends with the natural terrain.

3. **Scientific Literature:**
   Research published in scientific journals also supports the fact that human-made structures are generally not visible from space without the use of zoom lenses or other optical aids. The Great Wall is no exception.

**Conclusion:**
The statement "The Great Wall of China is the only man-made structure visible from space with the naked eye" is inaccurate. Reliable sources, including NASA and astronaut accounts, confirm that the Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. Additionally, other human-made structures are also not visible without assistance. This myth has been debunked through various reliable sources.
