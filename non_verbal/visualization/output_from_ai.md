To visualize the sales performance over the year, we can create a line chart using Python's Matplotlib library. Here's an example of how to generate the chart:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Dataset
months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June",
          "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
sales_amounts = [15000, 18000, 17000, 16000, 22000, 25000, 
                 23000, 21000, 19000, 24000, 26000, 30000]

# Create the line chart
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(months, sales_amounts, marker='o', linestyle='-', color='b')

# Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Sales Amount ($)')
plt.title('Monthly Sales Performance Over the Year')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.grid(True)

# Show the chart
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

**Corresponding Visualization:**
![Monthly Sales Performance Over the Year](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Monthly+Sales+Performance+Over+the+Year)

**Explanation:**
- **X-axis (Month):** This axis represents the months of the year.
- **Y-axis (Sales Amount):** This axis represents the sales amount in dollars.
- **Title:** The chart is titled "Monthly Sales Performance Over the Year" to provide context.

The line chart clearly shows the trend of sales performance throughout the year, highlighting peaks and troughs in sales. This visualization makes it easy to identify which months had the highest and lowest sales, providing valuable insights for decision-making.
